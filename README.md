# Lexicon-Sentiment-Analysis-Unsupervised-Type-Corona_tweets-
## The project showcased the ability to use lexicon-based models to gain insights from unlabeled data and demonstrated a strong understanding of data preprocessing techniques and data analysis methods using concepts of Natural Language Processing.

### Demonstrated the use of lexicon-based models for sentiment analysis to tackle unsupervised learning problems, where labeled data is not available. Explored popular lexicon-based models like VADER and TextBlob and performed data preprocessing to prepare the data for analysis. Built a model using VADER and evaluated its performance, followed by an analysis of emotions in the data to gain deeper insights.

### A Lexicon is a collection of words or phrases along with their associated meanings or sentiments. In the context of natural language processing and sentiment analysis, a lexicon usually refers to a dictionary of words and phrases that are assigned predefined sentiment scores or labels, such as positive, negative, or neutral. These sentiment scores or labels can be used to automatically determine the overall sentiment expressed in a text by aggregating the scores of the individual words and phrases in the lexicon. Lexicons are often used in lexicon-based models for sentiment analysis, which can be effective when labeled data is not available for training machine learning models.

### Most of the problems in actual practice are related to unsupervised learning, which means the label is absent (Positive/Negative). Majority of times companies do not find time to label it manually and hence settle for lexicon based models like Vader. Some, have built their own lexicons related to their field like Retail, News, etc. This notebook demonstrates lexicon based problem tackling.
